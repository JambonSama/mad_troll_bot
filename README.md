> This is the home repository for my Mad Troll Bot. Mad Troll Bot can populate a Discord server and troll your fellow tilted gamers on a voice channel, by playing an mp4 media of your choice.

# Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Clone the repo on your device `git@github.com:MacroController/MadTrollBot.git`.
1. Install [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/), since the troll bot requires it for now.
1. Create [your bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
1. Get the correct bot token, from the same URL, on your bot page, under the `bot` tab:
   - Text permissions:
     - read message history
   - Voice permissions:
     - connect
     - video
     - speak
   - General permissions
     - view channels
1. Insert the token in `index.js` file.
1. Invite the bot in the target server.

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Launch the code (this is the part that requires [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)).
1. Write the prompt in the general channel and have fun.

# Development

At some point I plan on implementing that in Python instead of js, since I dislike both, but Python less so than js.
